## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Activities also include a category and structured recurring schedule metadata
for filtering and sorting. `schedule_days` uses ISO weekday numbers (Monday is
1, Sunday is 7), and `start_time` uses 24-hour `HH:MM`; the human-readable
`schedule` remains available for display.

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
